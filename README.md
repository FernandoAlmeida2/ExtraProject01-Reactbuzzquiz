# Off Project 01: BuzzQuiz [React]


## About The Project

This project is a platform to create quizzes, this time using **React**. It's a project for bootcamp training, so the purpose is exclusively for learning and gaining experience. That was the most advanced project for me until now. I was able to practice all the content that I learned in this module, and challenge myself in dealing with more advanced problems.
